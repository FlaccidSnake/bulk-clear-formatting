## Use-case
An addon to bulk remove formatting from fields, since search and replace really doesn't work for html, and sometimes bulk html edits need undoing and Ctrl+Z doesn't work.

## How to use
1. Browser Menu Bar
   - Select notes
   - Edit → Bulk-Clear Formatting

2. Browser Context Menu
   - Select one or more notes/cards in the browser
   - Right-click → Clear Formatting...
   - Opens the same dialog

3. Editor Context Menu
   - Right-click while editing a field
   - Clear Formatting in '[Field Name]' or Clear Formatting in All Fields
